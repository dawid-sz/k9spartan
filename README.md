Portfolio website for dog training school in Poland

My good friends from Poland are training dogs. They are doing incredible work and also helped us with our german shepherd puppy. That's why I would love to dedicate one of the projects to them. I would like to deliver the best portfolio website they could ever have.

I'll use the vanilla technologies HTML, CSS and JS. No frameworks.
